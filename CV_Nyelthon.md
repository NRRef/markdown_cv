## SUMMARY
With over 8 years of software development and 6+ years of professional experience I am looking for full-stack or mobile engineering opportunities as a full-time contractor. I also have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering.
My backend proficiency extends to .NET Core, C#, NodeJS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. On the front end, I’m skilled in  React, Typescript, JavaScript, and styled-components. At mobile development, I’ve worked with Flutter and React Native.
My experience includes testing with Jest, XUnit, and Cypress covering unit, component, and integration tests. CI/CD with AWS, Azure, and Gitlab was part of my responsibilities, and I have hands-on familiarity with RabbitMQ, Redis, Kibana, and Datadog.
